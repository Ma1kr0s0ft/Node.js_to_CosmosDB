# Node.js_to_CosmosDB

Build a database app to store and query data in Azure Cosmos DB by using Visual Studio Code and Node.js.

Note in the manual the VS Code extension is still taken and not the Azure / Azure Database.
In the current extension you will find the Cosmos DB under Databases.
The Azure Cosmos SQL is called Core (SQL) in the new version.
